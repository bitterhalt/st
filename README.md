### Theming
* This build of ST has xresources-patch, meaning you can manage colors, fonts etc. through your .Xresources -file
* You must run: ```xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources``` to apply colors
* If you want, you can copy contents of **example-xresources** to your **$HOME/.Xresources** and xrdb -merge it
